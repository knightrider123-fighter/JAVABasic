Below is your Week-1 study plan in full detail, explaining exactly what to study, what to write in notes, and what to practice under each topic.
This is designed for job-switch preparation for backend Java developer.


---

✅ WEEK 1 — OOP + CORE JAVA BASICS (DETAILED PLAN)

Goal: Build deep understanding of OOP + Collections + Generics + DSA fundamentals.


---

⭐ DAY 1 — OOP Concepts (Deep)

📘 What to Study

1. What is OOP?

Definition of Object-Oriented Programming

Why OOP is used in real projects

Benefits:

Maintainability

Reusability

Scalability

Security

Faster development


Difference between Procedure-oriented vs Object-oriented



---

2. Class & Object

What is a Class?

What is an Object?

How memory allocation works? (heap, stack)

Creating object with new

Instance variables & methods

this keyword basics



---

3. Encapsulation

Binding data & methods

private variables + public getters/setters

Why? → Data hiding & security

Real example → User class: username, password



---

4. Inheritance

extends keyword

Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical

What Java does NOT support → Multiple inheritance (from class)

Why? → Diamond problem

What is inherited?

What is NOT inherited? (private members, constructors)



---

5. Polymorphism

Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Same method name, different parameters

Rules to overload method

Real example: add(int a, int b) / add(double a, double b)


Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Same method name, same parameters, different implementation

@Override annotation

Achieved through dynamic method dispatch

Used in Spring Boot Beans & Interfaces



---

6. Abstraction

Hiding implementation

Using interfaces & abstract classes

100% abstraction via Interface

Example: JDBC, Spring Boot services



---

7. Interface vs Abstract Class

Feature	Interface	Abstract Class

Variables	public static final	normal variables allowed
Methods	abstract + default + static	abstract + normal
Multiple inheritance	YES	NO
Constructor	NO	YES



---

8. Why OOP in Real Backend Projects?

All enterprise Java frameworks (Spring, Hibernate) are based on OOP

Controllers, Services, Repositories = Polymorphism

DTO models = Encapsulation

Interfaces = Dependency injection

Inheritance for common functionality



---

⭐ Practice

Create Parent → Child (inheritance)

Override method

Create interface & abstract class

Implement both in classes



---

⭐ DAY 2 — OOP Advanced

📘 What to Study

1. Access Modifiers

public

private

protected

default

Access scope table (class → pkg → subclass → everywhere)



---

2. Constructors

Default constructor

Parameterized constructor

Custom copy constructor

Constructor overloading

Why Java doesn’t have true copy constructor?



---

3. this & super

this

Access instance variables

Call another constructor (this())


super

Call parent constructor

Access parent variable/method




---

4. final

final variable → constant

final method → cannot override

final class → cannot extend (String class)



---

5. static

static variable → class level shared memory

static method → cannot access non-static

static block → loads once when class loads

static vs instance memory difference



---

⭐ Practice

Show static behavior using counter

Constructor chaining using super()

Program showing final usage



---

⭐ DAY 3 — Collections (Basic)

📘 What to Study

1. What is a Collection?

Framework to store, manipulate group of objects

Difference between Collection interface vs Collections utility class



---

2. List

ArrayList

Internal working → dynamic array

Default size → 10

Resizing logic

Fast access (O(1)), slow insertion/deletion


LinkedList

Doubly linked list

Each node has prev & next

Fast insertion/deletion

Slow random access



---

3. Set

HashSet

Unique elements

Uses HashMap internally (dummy value)

No order guarantee


TreeSet

Sorted order

Uses Red-Black Tree



---

⭐ Practice

Iterate using forEach & Iterator

Remove duplicates from list using HashSet



---

⭐ DAY 4 — Collections Advanced

📘 What to Study

1. Map Interface

Key-value pairs

Diff between List & Map

Null key/value rules


HashMap

What is hashing?

hashCode(), equals()

Buckets, LinkedList inside bucket

Collision handling

Load factor (0.75)

Rehashing (resize old size * 2)


LinkedHashMap

Maintains insertion order


TreeMap

Sorted map

Uses Red-Black tree



---

⭐ Practice

Count frequency of characters

Sort map using TreeMap



---

⭐ DAY 5 — Collections Utility + Comparator

📘 What to Study

1. Comparable vs Comparator

Comparable → natural sorting (implements Comparable<T>)

Comparator → custom sorting (using Comparator<T>)

Difference in design

When to use which?



---

2. Collections Class

Collections.sort()

Collections.reverse()

Collections.max(), min()



---

⭐ Practice

Sort list of objects by

name ascending

age descending

salary custom comparator




---

⭐ DAY 6 — Generics

📘 What to Study

1. Why Generics?

Type safety

Avoids ClassCastException

Used everywhere in Collections



---

2. Generic Class

class Box<T> {
  T value;
}


---

3. Generic Methods

<T> void print(T x)


---

4. Wildcards

? → unknown type

? extends Number → upper bound

? super Integer → lower bound

Real use cases in Collections API



---

⭐ Practice

Create generic class Pair<K,V>

Create generic method printArray()



---

⭐ DAY 7 — Weekly Revision + DSA Easy

📝 Revision

All OOP topics

Collections basics + internal

Generics



---

🔥 LeetCode (Easy)

1. Two Sum


2. Reverse String


3. Move Zeroes
(You will practice array, hashmap, two pointers here)




---

🎯 Should you study basic Core Java again?

👉 YES — but focused revision, not deep reading.

Study only:

Data types

Loops

Control statements

Arrays

String & StringBuilder

Exception handling basics

JVM + stack vs heap

Package structure

Basic file reading/writing


These basics strengthen your OOP + Collections understanding.

If you want, I can generate:

✅ Daily notes (PDF style)
✅ Daily coding tasks
✅ Daily interview questions
✅ MCQs for each topic
Just tell me “Generate Day 1 notes” or “Give Day 2 MCQs”.
